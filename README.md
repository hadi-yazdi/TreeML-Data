# TreeML-Data

The TreeML-Data consists of labelled point clouds of 40 scanning projects of streets in Munich, 3,755 leaf-off point clouds of individual trees, quantitative structure models (QSM), tree structure measurements, and tree graph structure models of the trees in these streets. The dataset offers valuable data for generating and evaluating models in various scientific disciplines, which include remote sensing, computer vision, machine learning, urban forestry, urban ecosystem, green architecture, and graph analysis.
